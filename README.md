# About Indoor Garden
Indoor Garden is a company that follows the trend in the world of design and creates gardens designed to improve the living and working space.
The global problem of air pollution, the fast-paced lifestyle, the fact that people spend much of their time indoors (where the air can be several times more polluted than the outside, due to the materials contained in furniture, clothing, building materials) and the effort from people from urban areas to make life as stress-free as possible, are the main driving factors of the idea of forming Indoor Garden.
The small gardens are made of natural materials, with plants that according to the recommendations of Feng Shui specialists generate good "chi", and at the same time they are tested by NASA and according to their study are the best for filtering the air in the interior. Each garden is original and in accordance with the Eastern Zen philosophy, and in a subtle way helps to calm the mind, relax and unwind.
Behind the Indoor Garden is a team of young people whose goal is to bring this green art into people's lives. In addition to aesthetic enjoyment and beautification of the space, small gardens allow you to enjoy the benefits of plants, while helping to relax and focus, leading to increased productivity, creativity, generating ideas and improving the quality of life.
